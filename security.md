# Cloud Security module
Security Scan module focused on historical threat detection via log analysis and security findings review. This leverages the same data collection foundation but applies a different "framework" (threat intelligence and detection rules) and produces security-focused outputs.

Here is the outline for the Security Scan Component, with a little more detail on the 'how':

**Key Points & Plan: Security Scan Module**

Core Concept:

Perform point-in-time analysis of historical cloud logs and security service findings (from AWS services like CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty, Security Hub, Shield, etc.) to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), anomalous activity, or potential threat events that may have been missed by real-time systems.

Relationship to Other Modules:

This is another complementary module that uses the shared Data Collection Engine.

- While the Compliance Module checks against regulatory rules, and the WAF Module checks against architectural best practices, the Security Scan Module checks against **known threat patterns and indicators**.
- It adds a crucial layer of **detective control** and **historical visibility** to the platform, directly supporting the "secure" and "observable" aspects of your core positioning, and is vital for incident response and audit trails required by regulated industries.

Core Value Proposition:

Provide clients with a security posture snapshot focused on detecting hidden threats or confirming a lack of compromise over a specified historical period. Offer confidence by identifying potential security gaps or past incidents that may have gone unnoticed, complementing real-time monitoring efforts.

**The Plan - Integration into the Phased Roadmap:**

Develop this module alongside or after establishing the core data collection and initial Compliance/WAF mapping capabilities.

- **Integration in Phase 1 (Deepen & Package):**
    
    - **Action:** Enhance the Data Collection Engine to efficiently handle _log data streams_ (CloudTrail, VPC Flow, etc.) in addition to configuration/state data. This involves handling potentially large volumes of time-series data.
    - **Action:** Build the initial "Detection Engine" â€“ logic to parse key log types and identify simple suspicious patterns or match against a basic list of known bad IPs/signatures. Integrate with native AWS security findings services (Security Hub, GuardDuty) via API.
- **Integration in Phase 2 (Build Visibility & Strategic Value):**
    
    - **Action:** Incorporate "historical threat hunting," "post-breach analysis readiness," and "security posture validation" into your brand messaging. Share insights from common historical findings.
    - **Action:** Offer a "Cloud Security Threat Snapshot" or "Historical Activity Review" as a specific strategic advisory service.
- **Integration in Phase 3 (Scale & Own):**
    
    - **Action:** Package automated historical security scanning as a repeatable service or a feature within your platform/brand.
    - **Action:** Explore offering periodic (e.g., quarterly) automated threat scans as a subscription add-on.

Product Suite Blueprint / IP-Led Engagement Model (Security Scan Module):

This follows the familiar structure, adapted for security analysis:

1. **Discovery & Onboarding:** (Similar to others) Define scope (accounts, regions), agree on log sources to analyze, and specify the historical time period for the scan.
2. **Data Collection Engine:** (Shared & Enhanced)
    - **Goal:** Collect relevant historical log data (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, S3 Access Logs, DNS logs if available, etc.) and findings from security services (Security Hub, GuardDuty archived findings).
    - **How:** This might involve querying services like CloudWatch Logs Insights, using AWS Athena/Glue to run SQL queries over logs stored in S3, fetching findings from Security Hub/GuardDuty APIs, or potentially using dedicated log collection/forwarding if clients have centralized logging setups. You'll need mechanisms to handle potentially large data volumes and normalize different log formats.
3. **Threat Detection & Mapping Layer:**
    - **Goal:** Analyze the collected logs and findings to identify patterns indicative of malicious activity or known IoCs.
    - **How:** This is where the "framework" is dynamic.
        - **Pattern Matching:** Write rules (can be regular expressions, specific query logic for Athena/Logs Insights, or rules in a processing engine) to look for suspicious sequences of events (e.g., user switches roles multiple times rapidly, attempts to access sensitive data after a failed login, unusual network traffic flows in VPC logs).
        - **IoC Matching:** Compare source/destination IPs from logs (VPC Flow, CloudTrail) against known lists of malicious IPs. Compare user agent strings, requested URLs, or file hashes (if available in logs) against threat intelligence feeds.
        - **Findings Consolidation:** Ingest, filter, and prioritize findings from AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, Macie, etc., which already perform some level of detection. Add your own correlation logic on top.
        - **Threat Intelligence (TI) Integration:** _Crucially_, you need access to _current_ threat intelligence. This could involve integrating with free public feeds or, for more robust capabilities, commercial TI APIs (e.g., from Proofpoint, CrowdStrike, etc.) to check IPs, domains, hashes. Your "Mapping Layer" here is a "Detection Engine" that applies these rules and IoC lookups.
    - **IP Here:** Your library of detection rules, your process for integrating and querying threat intelligence, and your correlation logic across different log sources.
4. **Dashboards & Executive View (Security Scan):**
    - **Goal:** Visualize potential security threats found during the scan.
    - **How:** Dashboards showing: number of potential threats found, breakdown by severity (High, Medium, Low), types of threats detected (e.g., suspicious access, data exfiltration attempts, known bad IPs), a timeline of detected events, affected resources.
    - **IP Here:** Dashboards designed for security review, potentially linking findings back to raw log entries for investigation.
5. **Report Generation & Delivery (Security Scan):**
    - **Goal:** Provide a formal report detailing the findings of the historical security scan.
    - **How:** Reports should list each detected potential threat event, provide context (what rule triggered, what IoC was matched), show the evidence (relevant log entries or finding IDs), identify the affected resources, and suggest immediate next steps for investigation and response.
    - **IP Here:** Report templates structured for security posture review and incident follow-up.
6. **Incident Flagging & Integration:**
    - **Goal:** Make it easy for clients to act on findings.
    - **How:** While not real-time _response_, integrate with client's incident management workflows (e.g., automatically create tickets in Jira/ServiceNow for high-severity findings), or provide clear, actionable recommendations in the report.
    - **IP Here:** Playbooks or templates for investigating common findings.
7. **Continuous Improvement:** Update detection rules, integrate new threat intelligence sources, add support for new log types or security services as they emerge.

**Go-To-Market (GTM) - Product-Led Growth (Security Scan):**

- Offer a "Free Cloud Security Health Check" focusing on a limited scan for critical IoCs in CloudTrail.
- Upsell to a "Deep Historical Threat Scan & Report" covering multiple log sources over a longer period (paid product).
- Offer "Threat Investigation Support" or "Incident Response Readiness Review" as advisory services based on the scan results.
- Position this as a valuable compliance artifact ("Proving due diligence in threat detection") or a service for mergers/acquisitions or post-incident validation.

**Key IP to Build (Security Scan Specific):**

- Robust log collection and parsing pipelines for diverse AWS security logs.
- A comprehensive and _updatable_ library of detection rules and patterns for cloud environments.
- Mechanisms for integrating and leveraging threat intelligence feeds.
- Dashboards and reports tailored to presenting security findings clearly and actionably.
- Process/playbooks for translating scan findings into investigative steps.

**Approach & Tools (Security Scan):**

- **Data Collection:** AWS services like CloudWatch Logs Insights, Athena, Glue, S3 Select, Boto3 scripting. Consider tools like Fluentd/Fluent Bit or Logstash if clients have complex logging setups, but start with native AWS querying.
- **Threat Detection Engine:** Can be built using scripting (Python), leveraging OpenSearch/Elasticsearch with detection rules, or integrating with specialized security tools that can process logs. Writing correlation rules (e.g., "If X event happens, followed by Y event on the same resource within Z minutes") is key.
- **Threat Intelligence:** Utilize APIs from sources like VirusTotal (limited free), AbuseIPDB (for IPs), or commercial TI platforms. Your system will need to query these APIs or ingest their data feeds.
- **Reporting/Dashboards:** Same tools as before (Grafana, custom frontends, markdown generators), just focused on security visualizations and reports.

This Security Scan module completes a powerful trifecta: **Compliance (Are we following the rules?), Well-Architected (Are we building systems right?), and Security Scan (Are there signs we've been compromised?).** All built from a shared data foundation, leading to a highly differentiated offering.
